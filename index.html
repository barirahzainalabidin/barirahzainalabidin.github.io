        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Barirah Zainal Abidin, and I am from Malaysia. Currently, I am a Machine Learning Practitioner on Kaggle, but my journey to this point has been anything but straightforward. It began in 2016 when I embarked on my entrepreneurial path, managing five different businesses. My ventures included selling perfumes and scarves, as well as dealing in wholesale products sourced from Alibaba and local suppliers. For me, business was more than just a way to make money, it was a passion. I enjoy researching market trends, experimenting with innovative ideas, and discovering what strategies work best. With 7 years of experience in advertising and collaborative marketing, I have successfully worked with influencers and artists in Malaysia, developing my skills in effective product promotions.</p>

        <h2>My Journey in Machine Learning</h2>

        <p>This portfolio showcases a collection of notebooks I have developed for data analysis and the exploration of machine learning algorithms and pipelines.</p>

        <h2>Kaggle Competitions</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the Kaggle competitions I have participated in:</p>
